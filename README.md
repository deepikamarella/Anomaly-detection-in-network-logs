## ***Description*** 📝
                In this paper, we tackle the challenge of detecting network log file anomalies. In a controlled environment, network devices like routers, switches, firewalls, and servers generate log files containing details about network activities: traffic, device settings, user behavior, and security events. Analyzing these logs is crucial for pinpointing security threats and network issues. Researchers aim to swiftly and effectively identify anomalies by examining log data. In our study, we employ the Isolation Forest (iForest) machine-learning approach and explore clustering algorithms like OPTICS and DBSCAN to detect real-time log anomalies. We assess and compare each model's performance. Ultimately, we present experimental results demonstrating the method's efficacy and discuss future directions in real-time log-based anomaly detection, emphasizing the need for advanced and efficient approaches to tackle the growing complexity and scale of modern networks.
