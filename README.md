## ***Description*** 📝 
                In our study, we employ the Isolation Forest (iForest) machine-learning approach and explore clustering algorithms like OPTICS 
                and DBSCAN to detect real-time log anomalies. We assess and compare each model's performance. Ultimately, we present experimental 
                results demonstrating the method's efficacy and discuss future directions in real-time log-based anomaly detection, emphasizing the 
                need for advanced and efficient approaches to tackle the growing complexity and scale of modern networks.
