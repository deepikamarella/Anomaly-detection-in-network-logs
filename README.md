## ***Description*** 📝 
                In our study, we employ the Isolation Forest (iForest) machine-learning approach and explore clustering algorithms like OPTICS 
                and DBSCAN to detect real-time log anomalies. We assess and compare each model's performance. Ultimately, we present experimental 
                results demonstrating the method's efficacy and discuss future directions in real-time log-based anomaly detection, emphasizing the 
                need for advanced and efficient approaches to tackle the growing complexity and scale of modern networks.
                
## ***Dataset/Experimental Setup *** 📝 
                The solution presented in this paper was tested on a real-time log dataset collected from 10 computer network laboratory systems at our institution. 
                The logs span from October 7, 2022, 12:00 AM to February 24, 2023, 11:59 PM, totaling 2,600,1990 log entries or 788 MB in size. 
                These logs were collected over a six-day period, and for our experiments, we utilized 1 million out of the available 20 million logs.
